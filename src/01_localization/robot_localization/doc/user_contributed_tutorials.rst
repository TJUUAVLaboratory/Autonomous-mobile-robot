Tutorials
=========

* `ros-sensor-fusion-tutorial <https://github.com/methylDragon/ros-sensor-fusion-tutorial>`_
    A comprehensive end-to-end tutorial for setting up robot_localization for sensor fusion, as well as running through the necessary concepts. (Includes a practical example of setting it up with ultrasonic beacons!)

* `Kapernikov: The ROS robot_localization package <https://kapernikov.com/the-ros-robot_localization-package/>`_
    The documentation of the robot_localization package is quite clear once you know how it works. However, it lacks a hands-on tutorial to help you with your first steps. There are some great examples on how to set up the robot_localization package, but they require good working hardware. This tutorial tries to bridge the gap, using the turtlesim package as a virtual robot.
